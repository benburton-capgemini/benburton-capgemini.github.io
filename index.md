# About me

I'm Ben, a Software Engineer currently working in Nottingham. I have been working on enterprise .NET applications for nearly 5 years. I am experienced developing for the Web using C&#35;, ASP.NET (MVC) along with HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript and AngularJS on the front-end. I'm passionate about Agile software delivery, specifically Scrum, and use tools and frameworks such as BDD, TDD and DevOps to build working software.

I'm currently writing entries for an A-Z of tools and technologies I've come across; check back later for more.
