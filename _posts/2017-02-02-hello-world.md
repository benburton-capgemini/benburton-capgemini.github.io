# Hello World!

This is the first post on my blog so let me explain a bit about how it all works. The content of this page is a simple Markdown file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language; sites like Stack Overflow and GitHub use it to allow users the ability to compose rich text. Questions on Stack Overflow are formatted so they're easier to read and README files on GitHub are structured elegantly with code samples presented nicely. A simple syntax is used to define headers, lists, links, quotes and common formatting such as bold and italic text. It's also just as easy to use less common features such as strikethrough and sub/superscript. Markdown can be stored and rendered as HTML on a webpage. It's written inside any plain text editor although you can make use of a Markdown editor which is a more user friendly experience - a spellchecker is handy! Basically, it makes writing blog posts like this easy. All of the content here will be stored as static files in an open source repository (so you can find the Markdown code for this post). GitHub Pages and Jekyll make doing this possible; I'll go into more detail about how my site works another time.
